# DeepDiveR
R package to compute decompression profiles for deep, multigas scuba dives

This is a work in progress. An old version is available online as [a Shiny app](https://diving.shinyapps.io/DivingPlan/). 

I'm recoding this more than 10 years later as a "modern" R package with proper examples, documentation and vignette. This might take some time...
